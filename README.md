# Cellula Week 1 Project

This repository contains the deliverables for the **Cellula Week 1 Project**, structured into three main tasks: LSTM training, BERT family and fine-tuning short research, and a bonus fine-tuning experiment.

## 📝 Tasks

### **Task 0: Project Structure**
- Create a folder named `Cellula_1week_[YourName]`.
- Inside, include three subfolders:
  - `LSTM`
  - `BERT family`
  - `Bonus`

---

### **Task 1: LSTM Training**
- Train an **LSTM model** on the provided dataset.
- Place training code in the `LSTM` folder.
- Include a **PDF report** with results and metrics (F1 score required).
- **Bonus points** for:
  - Graphs (e.g., training curves)
  - Confusion matrix visualization

---

### **Task 2: BERT Research**
- Write a short research report (max **5 pages**) on **DistilBERT and ALBERT**.
- Write a research report (max **3 pages**) on **LoRA and QLoRA**.
- Save both reports as PDFs inside the `BERT family` folder.
- **Bonus points** for preparing reports in **LaTeX**.

---

### **Task 3: Bonus**
- Fine-tune either **DistilBERT** or **ALBERT** using **LoRA** on the same dataset.
- Place training code and a **PDF report** with results in the `Bonus` folder.

---

## 📊 Evaluation
- **Primary metric:** F1 score
- Additional consideration for:
  - Quality of analysis in reports
  - Inclusion of graphs and confusion matrices
  - Use of LaTeX for research documents

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate into the desired folder (`LSTM`, `BERT family`, or `Bonus`).
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks for code implementation.
3. Refer to the PDFs for results and research summaries.

---

## ✨ Notes
- Ensure all dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers) are installed before running notebooks.
- Reports are written to be concise, structured, and aligned with task requirements.
